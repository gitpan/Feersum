=head1 NAME

Feersum::Connection - HTTP connection encapsulation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

For a streaming response:

    Feersum->endjinn->request_handler(sub {
        my $req = shift; # this is a Feersum::Connection object
        my $env = $req->env();
        my $w = $req->start_streaming(200, ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain']);
        # then immediately or after some time:
        $w->write("Ergrates ");
        $w->write(\"FTW.");
        $w->close();
    });

For a response with a Content-Length header:

    Feersum->endjinn->request_handler(sub {
        my $req = shift; # this is a Feersum::Connection object
        my $env = $req->env();
        $req->start_whole_response(200, ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain']);
        $req->write_whole_body(\"Ergrates FTW.");
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Encapsulates an HTTP connection to Feersum.  It's roughly analagous to an
C<Apache::Request> or C<Apache2::Connection> object, but differs significantly
in functionality.

Until Keep-Alive functionality is supported (if ever) this means that a
connection is B<also> a request.

See L<Feersum> for more examples on usage.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<< my $env = $req->env() >>

Obtain an environment hash.  This hash contains the same entries as for a PSGI
handler environment hash.  See L<Feersum> for details on the contents.

This is a method instead of a parameter so that future versions of Feersum can
request a slice of the hash for speed.

=item C<< my $w = $req->start_streaming($code, \@headers) >>

A full HTTP header section is sent with "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" (or
"Connection: close" for HTTP/1.0 clients).  

Returns a C<Feersum::Connection::Writer> handle which should be used to
complete the response.  See L<Feersum::Connection::Handle> for methods.

=item C<< $req->send_response($code, \@headers, $body) >>

=item C<< $req->send_response($code, \@headers, \@body) >>

Respond with a full HTTP header (including C<Content-Length>) and body.

Returns the number of bytes calculated for the body.

=item C<< $req->force_http10 >>

=item C<< $req->force_http11 >>

Force the response to use HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1, respectively.

Normally, if the request was made with 1.1 then Feersum uses HTTP/1.1 for the
response, otherwise HTTP/1.0 is used (this includes requests made with the
HTTP "0.9" non-declaration).

For streaming under HTTP/1.1 C<Transfer-Encoding: chunked> is used, otherwise
a C<Connection: close> stream-style is used (with the usual non-guarantees
about delivery).  You may know about certain user-agents that
support/don't-support T-E:chunked, so this is how you can override that.

Supposedly clients and a lot of proxies support the C<Connection: close>
stream-style, see support in Varnish at
http://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/ticket/400

=item C<< $req->fileno >>

The socket file-descriptor number for this connection.
